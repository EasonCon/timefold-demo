This is a Python version of the timefold demo for the PJS problem. The current Python version does not support weight sorting for discrete problems, and the constraint definition can only implement incremental constraint functions. Some Java version syntax is used in this demo, so there will be compilation issues. The author will rewrite this repository after the timefold team updates its Python support.
